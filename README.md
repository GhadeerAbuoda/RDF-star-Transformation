# RDF-star-Transformation

This repository contains the scripts and the code for analyzing the transforming RDF and RDF-star into property graphs.

# Files: 
- Test_Cases.ttl: These cases are used to evaluate the transformation approaches developed to transform RDF and RDF-star graphs into  property graphs. At a general level, the test cases can be classified into test cases related to the RDF model and RDF-str model-specific features. 
- Queries.md: Example Cypher queries for the Neo4j graph after importing RDF and RDF-star cases in Test_Cases.ttl.
