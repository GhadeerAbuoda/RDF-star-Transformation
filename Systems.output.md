This table presents the transformation output from RDF-star graphs into property graphs. The output is expressed by the canonical model.
The input for each case is an RDF set of triples (Triples Column). 
The output corresponds to the transformation by the three evaluated systems: Neosemantics, RDF-Star Tools Project, and RDF2PG.

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are 
$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $
